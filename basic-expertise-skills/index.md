## Operating system

There are three most commonly used operation systems for personal computers:
- Microsoft Windows
- Apple macOS
- Linux (CentOS, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, ...)

Most seismologists choose macOS or Linux as their primary operation system for daily researches, because both macOS and Linux provide easy access to toolchains needed in programming, and most existing programs/codes/packages for seismological researches were written on Linux and only work on Linux and macOS. As a beginner, you should use macOS or Linux.

Please refer to the following references for a brief introduction about them:

## Linux/macOS basis and Command Lines

Seismologists usually use command lines (CLI) rather than Graphic User Interface (GUI) to navigate around different folders/directories, run programs, process data and almost everything you can imagine, because using CLI is usually much efficient than using GUI.

## Prgramming Languages

### Compiled Language

You need at least master one compiled language. The most popular compiled languages used in seismology community are C and Fortran.

### Scripting Languages

Scripting Languages can also be called as interpreted Languages. It's usually easier to write and can accomplish complex tasks using only a few lines of codes. The only disadvantage is interpreted languages are usually much slower than compiled languages.

There are many interpreted languages, the most used in seismology community are bash, Python (recommanded) and Matlab.
